THIS IS A SMALL SCALE VERSION OF THE KDD CUP 2005 PROBLEM.

NOTE: 1. 5 CATEGORIES ARE USED INSTEAD OF 67
      2. CATEGORIES ARE NUMBERS AND NOT NAMES
      3. DATA IS SMALL (20 WORDS)
      4. NONE OF THE OTHER PARAMETERS/CONDITIONS ARE CHANGED
      5. IF QUERY IS GIVEN APART FROM THE EXISTING DATA NO OUTPUT IS PRINTED.

      3. DATA IS SMALL (20 WORDS)

CATEGORIES ARE NUMBERED AS FOLLOWS:

1. COMPUTERS-TECHNOLOGY/COMMUNICATION
2. SHOPPING
3. ENTERTAINMENT
4. LIVING- FINANCE/CAREER/RELATIONSHIP
5. SPORTS
6. Objects

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
1. USER INPUTS THE QUERY
2. splitquery() FUNCTION IS CALLED. IT RETURNS 0 IF THE QUERY HAS 2 WORDS ELSE RETURNS 1.
3. BASED ON RETURN VALUE OF STEP 2 fetchandfind() FUNCTION SEARCHES FOR THE QUERY IN GIVEN DATA FROM "data.txt"
4. FINAL CATEGORIZATION IS DONE BY category() FUNCTION WHICH CATEGORIZES THE GIVEN QUERY 

PROCEDURE TO GET THE OUTPUT:
1. INPUT THE QUERY FROM THE EXISTING DATA HAVING COMBINATION OF ATMOST 2 WORDS IN THE QUERY
2. IF THERE ARE COMMON CATEGORIES IN THE QUERY WORDS THEN THE COMMON CATEGORIES WILL BE THE FINAL CATEGORY
   ELSE THE ITEMS OF QUERY WORDS WILL BE THE FINAL CATEGORY
3. OUTPUT WILL BE THE CATEGORY NUMBERS MENTIONED ABOVE


PROGRAM VERSIONS:

1.C: READ FROM A FILE LINE BY LINE
2.C: IMPROVED VERSION OF 1.C THAT SPLITTING 2 WORD QUERY
3.C: IMPROVED VERSION OF 2.C THAT SEARCHES AND FETCHES FROM FILE
4.C: EXPECTED OUTPUT FOR EXACTLY 2 WORDS 
final.c: FINAL PROGRAM WITH EXPECTED OUTPUT CONSIDERING ABOVE CRITERIA
data.txt: CONTAINS DATA FROM WHERE IT IS TO BE SEARCHED 
Makefile: CONTAINS EXECUTABLE COMMANDS TO RUN THE PROGRAM. THIS IS DONE BY EXECUTING COMMAND "make" IN THE TERMINAL
