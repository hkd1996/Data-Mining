Classification of the Transport Layer Protocols using Neural Network in R

Description:
1. Dataset-KDD Cup 1999: For implementaion purpose we have taken only 3 protocols(TCP,UDP,ICMP)
   The entire dataset is divided into 3 csv files based on tcp,udp,and icmp
2. Implementaion: Implementaion is done using R. The package used is 'neuralnet' which uses 'mlp' function to train and test      the data.'final.R' is the program name
3. Results are summarized using Mean Square Error(MSE),Accuracy,Precision and Recall
